It is the world's oldest,<sup><a href=#>[19]</a></sup> flattest,<sup><a href=#>[20]</a></sup> and driest inhabited continent,<sup><a href=#>[21][22]</a></sup> with some of the least fertile soils.<sup><a href=#>[23][24]</a></sup> It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates including <a href=#>deserts</a> in the interior and <a href=#>tropical rainforests</a> along the <a href=#>coast</a>.
    <p style="font-size: 19px;">The ancestors of <strong>Aboriginal Australians</strong> began arriving from south-east Asia 50,000 to 65,000 years ago, during the last glacial period.<sup><a href="#">[25]</a></sup><sup><a href="#">[26]</a></sup><sup><a href="#">[27]</a></sup> They settled on the continent and formed approximately 250 distinct language groups by the time of European settlement, maintaining some of the longest known continuing artistic and religious traditions in the world.<sup><a href="#">[28]</a></sup> Australia's written history commenced with <a href="#">Dutch exploration</a> of most of the coastline in the 17th-century. British colonisation began in 1788 with the establishment of the penal colony of <a href="#">New South Wales</a>. By the mid-19th century, most of the continent had been explored by European settlers and five additional self-governing British colonies were established, each gaining responsible government by 1890. The colonies federated in 1901, forming the <strong>Commonwealth of Australia</strong>.<sup><a href="#">[29]</a></sup> This continued a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the <a href="#">Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942</a>, and culminating in the <a href="#">Australia Acts of 1986</a>.<sup><a href="#">[29]</a></sup> </p>

    <h2>Etymology</h2>  
    <hr>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Main article: Name of Australia</i></p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">The name <strong>Australia</strong> is derived from the Latin <em>Terra Australis</em> ('southern land'), a name used for a hypothetical continent in the Southern Hemisphere since ancient times.<sup><a href="#">[42]</a></sup> Several 16th-century cartographers used the word <strong>Australia</strong> on maps, but not to identify modern Australia.<sup><a href="#">[43]</a></sup> When Europeans began visiting and mapping Australia in the 17th century, the name <em>Terra Australis</em> was applied to the new territories.<sup><a href="#">[N 5]</a></sup></p>
